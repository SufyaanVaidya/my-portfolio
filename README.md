## Installation

1. i created a repository to store and update the files in github.
2. After the repo was created i created the base files and pushed them to the repo.
3. When the base files were added i begain to code mt html and css docs.
4. To start i made sure the page had a viewport and the html structure.
5. Once the structure was made i added titles, links, headers, and p tags to create its base.
6. When the base was there i gave each element that needed to be targeted a class or an id.
7. On css with the tags and their classes/id's i began to target and style each tag.
8. After the tags were styled i made everything line up in the correct order i wanted.
9. When in order i made the nav links travel through the page.
10. Once the pages were finished i added a self picture and moved it to line up with the center.
