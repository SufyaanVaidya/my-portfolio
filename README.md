## Installation

1. i created a repository to store and update the files in github.
2. After the repo was created i created the base files and pushed them to the repo.
3. When the starter files were added i begain to remove non-semantic elements and replace them with semantic elements.
4. After adding the semantic elements i gave all images an alt tags describing them, and corrected any missing links and id's.
5. When all the alt tags were added i when through the html file and put the headings in sequential order.
6. Once the headings were in order all the html had left was a new and fitting title in which i added.
7. After completing the html file i began editing the css file elements to match the semantic elements on the html.
8. Once all the elements matched i began to comment on the css file above each line of code i modified.
9. Finally, i added an MIT license to my repository.
